# BattleShip-Game

This project is the two-dimensional battleship game between a player and computer.
Player ships are reads though a CSV file whereas the computer ships are arranged randomly.
Once after the arrangement is completed, both the player will start firing torpedoâ€™s on the other player. 
Whoever destruct the other ships first, they are the winners.

We have initialized two classes namely Ships and ShipGrids.
As per the file provided Ships class will assign all the ships in the board of 10X10 size. 
It will consist of accessor and mutator function declarations and random generation member functions

The class ShipGrids consist of memberfunctions which will have ship assignment, shipintersection,shotormiss,shipsunk 
and check member functions.
